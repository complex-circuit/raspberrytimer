# Raspberry Timer
The RaspberryPi times my cube solves. It is best to use the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ because slow processors can interfere with performance.
The circuit has been set up with 2 buttons in series with a pull-up resistor implimented by the computer, so you don't need to commect one. They are connected to *GND* and *GPIO pin 18*

Possible Future Enhancements
----------------------------
Light will be added and turn on when the computer is timing the solve
